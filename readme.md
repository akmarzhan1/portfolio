## Akma's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website repo! I use basic JS/HTML/CSS and three.js with models imported from Blender to add a twist. The three.js parts were inspired by Bruno Simon's course. 

I added some of my earlier projects, feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
## Setup

To run this repo, you will need to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and execute the following commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

Happy coding!
